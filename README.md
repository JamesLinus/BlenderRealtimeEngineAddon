BlenderRealtimeEngineAddon
==========================

An addon to allow external real time engines (e.g. game engines) to use Blender as an editor and allow for closer integration.

This addon does not do much on it's own. To see it in action with Panda3D, check out [BlenderPanda](https://github.com/Moguri/BlenderPanda)
